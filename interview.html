	<h1>How to Nail an Interview</h1>
	<p class="first">The hardest part is now over. Your resume was chosen and you feel like you have your foot in the door. You have a small chunk of time to convince the interviewer that you're the best candidate for the job and make a good impression.</p>

	<p class="research"><b>Do Your Research</b> -Find out as much about the company and its people as possible. Review the highs and lows of the company and the most important parts. Knowing important facts about the company you're trying to work at shows that you're already invested in their business and continued success. Ask about upcoming goals to demonstrate how you're thinking about your role in the company's future.</p>

	<p class="practice"><b>Rehearse Your Responses (but Don't Make Them Sound Rehearsed)</b> -It's very important to have quick comebacks to difficult questions. Have good answers to questions that would usually stump those being interviewed, such as, "What is your greatest weakness?" and "Talk about a time when you resolved a conflict on the job." Having quick and straight to the point answers will make you stand out. Practice so your words are clear and concise but not programmed.</p>

	<p class="small-talk"><b>Make Strategic Small Talk</b> -When the time is right, usually before or after the interview, make small talk with your interviewer. Use the small talk to point out character and things you do outside of work that makes you seem interesting.</p>

	<p class="confidence"><b>Exude Confidence and Congeniality</b> -Confidence goes hand-in-hand with success and congeniality will definitely leave a lasting impression. Employers want someone that is generally a pleasure to be around. Before you step in the room, breathe and remind yourself to be calm.</p>
